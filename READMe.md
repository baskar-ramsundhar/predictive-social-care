# Predicting Hospital Readmissions for Elderly Individuals Receiving Home Care

This project aims to develop a data-driven system to predict the risk of hospital readmission for elderly individuals receiving home care in England. By identifying those at high risk, proactive interventions can be implemented to improve health outcomes and optimize resource allocation within the social care system.

## Project Overview

This project leverages data engineering and machine learning techniques to:

* **Acquire and integrate data:** Gather data from various sources, including primary care records, home care records, hospital episode statistics, and social care assessments.
* **Engineer relevant features:**  Extract and create meaningful features from the data to capture individual characteristics, medical history, social context, and care needs.
* **Develop a predictive model:** Train and evaluate a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of hospital readmission.
* **Deploy and monitor the model:**  Integrate the model into a system for real-time or batch prediction, and continuously monitor its performance.
* **Facilitate interventions:**  Use the model's predictions to trigger proactive interventions, such as increased home care visits, telehealth monitoring, and medication reviews.

## Data Sources

* **Primary Care Records:** GP visits, diagnoses, medications.
* **Home Care Records:** Visit frequency, types of care provided, observations by care workers.
* **Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) Data:** Hospital admissions, diagnoses, procedures, length of stay.
* **Social Care Assessments:** Needs assessments conducted by local authorities.

## Data Acquisition & Preparation

* **Establish data sharing agreements** with relevant organizations (NHS trusts, local authorities, home care agencies).
* **Develop data extraction pipelines** using tools like Apache Airflow.
* **Clean and preprocess data:** Handle missing data, standardize formats, de-identify sensitive information.

## Feature Engineering

* **Select relevant features:** Demographics, medical history, home care data, social care assessments, hospital discharge information.
* **Create new features:** Comorbidity index, medication complexity, social vulnerability index, time since last hospitalization.
* **Scale and transform features:** Standardization, normalization, one-hot encoding.

## Model Development & Evaluation

* **Choose a suitable model:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees/Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks.
* **Split data into training and testing sets.**
* **Train and tune the model using cross-validation.**
* **Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC.**

## Deployment & Monitoring

* **Deploy the model for real-time or batch prediction.**
* **Develop a user interface with dashboards and alerts.**
* **Continuously monitor model performance and retrain as needed.**

## Intervention & Evaluation

* **Develop intervention strategies:** Proactive care, telehealth monitoring, medication reviews, social support.
* **Evaluate intervention effectiveness using A/B testing and outcome analysis.**

## Tools & Technologies

* **Programming Languages:** Python (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
* **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
* **Data Storage:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, BigQuery, Snowflake
* **Data Processing:** Apache Spark, Apache Flink
* **Workflow Management:** Apache Airflow
* **Visualization:** Tableau, Power BI
